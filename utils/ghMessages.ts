  This repository uses [BounTEA](https://github.com/sumitvekariya/bountea-website) to reward contributors with bounties via TEA Network's GPG-based Account Abstraction.
  
  When merging a pull request, contributors can **receive an agreed bounty amount in supported tokens directly to their GPG-derived wallet address**. 
  
  Funds are managed through TEA Network's secure escrow system and can be claimed using your GPG key for Account Abstraction.

  ---
  
  To request bounty distribution, comment using this template by specifying the **GPG addresses or wallet addresses** of the contributors involved and the **desired bounty amount** for each.
  
  \`\`\`
  Include any optional details related to your request here.
  
  ### Bounty distribution request
  
  - contributor@example.com (GPG) : 1000 USDC
  - 0x... : 500 USDC
  - reviewer@example.com (GPG) : 50 USDC
