# Privacy Policy

Effective date: November 2, 2022

Decentralized labs LTD (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the mte.slice.so website (the “Service”, "MTE").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data. We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### What is Personal Information?

When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you. It does not include aggregated or anonymized information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to you.

### Our Collection of Personal Information

We collect no information of those who sign up to MTE apart from the ID of the repo that MTE is installed into and information volunteered by the consumer. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organisations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

- It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.
- We transfer information about you if MTE is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, MTE will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### Cookies

We only use necessary cookies to record current session authentication.

### Source Code

MTE does not store any of the user's private source code unless given explicit, written permission to access their source code in order to provide support.
MTE does not store GitHub credentials. Using GitHub apps means we do not access your GitHub password and that you can revoke our access at any time.

### Data Storage

MTE uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the service. Although MTE owns the code, databases, and all rights to the application, you retain all rights to your data.

### Changes

MTE may periodically update this policy, without further notice to you and this will be reflected by a "last modified" date above. It is your responsibility to check this policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the Service following the posting of any changes to this policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.

We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a prominent notice on our site.
